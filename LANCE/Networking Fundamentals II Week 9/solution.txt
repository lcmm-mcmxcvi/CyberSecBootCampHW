Mission 1:
- To view the Mailservers for Starwars run: `nslookup -type=mx starwars.com`:

      starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx2.googlemail.com
      starwars.com    MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = aspmx.l.google.com
      starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx3.googlemail.com
      starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt1.aspx.l.google.com
      starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt2.aspmx.l.google.com
            
- The Resistance isn't receiving any email, because their new mailservers are not setup. A corrected Mailserver record should look like:
 
      starwars.com    MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = asltx.l.google.com
      starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = asltx.2.google.com
Mission 2:
- To view the SPF record, run: `nslookup -type=txt theforce.net`
 - The SPF record is: `v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215"`
 - The emails are going to spam because the new mailserver IP is not in the SPF record.
 - The new SPF record needs to include the new IP such as: `v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:45.23.176.21 ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215"`
Mission 3:
 - To view the CNAME, run the following NSLOOKUP Query: `nslookup -type=all www.theforce.net`
 - The CNAME records:` www.theforce.net        canonical name = theforce.net`
 - The subpage of resistance.theforce.net isn't redirecting because there isn't a CNAME for it.
 - A CNAME record should be added such as: `resistance.theforce.net         CNAME   theforce.net`
Mission 4:
To view the current NS records for princessleia.site run `nslookup -type=ns princessleia.site`:
            
      princessleia.site       nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com
      princessleia.site       nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com                       
             
 To fix this, you would add a secondary server such as   

      princessleia.site       nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com
      princessleia.site       nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com
      princessleia.site       nameserver = ns2.galaxybackup.com
 
Mission 5:
- The OSPF path from the planet of `Batuu` to the planet of  `Jedha`, that doesn't include Planet N is:

  `Batuu > D > C > E > F > J > I > L  > Q > T > V > Jedha` 
Mission 6:
- To Crack this wireless traffic, first save the file in Kali Linux in the directory: `usr/share/wordlists`.
- Change to the `usr/share/wordlists` directory.
- Make sure the `rockyou.txt ` is unzipped. If it is not, run `gunzip rockyou.txt.gzip`.

- Run the following Aircrack-ng command:
  - `aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt Darkside.pcap`

- This should crack the wireless key revealing: `dictionary`
- Open up Darkside.pcap in Wireshark. To decrypt the pcap, do the following:
  - Select `View` from toolbar, make sure the `Wireless Toolbar` is checked.
  - Return to the main Wireshark screen, select `802.11 preferences`.
  - When this screen pops up, make sure `Enable Decryption` is selected.
  - Select `Edit` below this option.
  - Add in the following decryption:
    - Keytype: wpa-pwd
    - Key:  dictionary:linksys
      - Note: this is the password and the SSID.
- Return back to the Wireshark Packet Capture.
- There are a few ways to view IP Addresses. One is to filter by ARP and view the ARP response in packet 315.
  - The packet details show several of the Private IPs and MAC Addresses in the network.
      ```
      Sender MAC address: Cisco-Li_e3:e4:01 (00:0f:66:e3:e4:01)
      Sender IP address: 172.16.0.1
      Target MAC address: IntelCor_55:98:ef (00:13:ce:55:98:ef)
      Target IP address: 172.16.0.101
      ```          
  - A DNS Filter will also show several IP addresses in the 10.x network.
Mission 7:
 -  To view the TXT record, run `nslookup -type=txt princessleia.site`.
 -  The TXT record shows: `Run the following in a Kali Linux command line: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`
 -  Running this on Kali Linux will play a Star Wars video.
