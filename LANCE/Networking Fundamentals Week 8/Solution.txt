Phase 1
- Ran "fping -g " command on all of the IP Addresses found on the Rock Star Server List
- Out of all the IP Addresses only "167.172.144.11" came back with a positive result
- a Ping command runs on the Network Layer of the OSI Layer

Mitigation:
-Rock Star Corp should disable Ping command by restricting ICMP Echo requests to all of their servers including "167.172.144.11".

Phase 2
- Running "sudo nmap -sS 167.172.144.11" shows that port 22 is open for SSH service
- SYN Scan runs on the Transport Layer of the OSI Layer

Mitigation:
-Rock Star Corp should consider filtering out SSH traffic to prevent unauthorized access to their server.

Phase 3
- Since SSH was open, we logged in the server using the default username and password.
"ssh jimi@167.172.144.11" "hendrix"
- Running "cat etc/hosts" pulled a list of ip addresses
The hosts file had 98.137.246.8 rollingstone.com
- Running "nslookup 98.137.246.8" shows the domain name " name = media-router-fp2.prod1.media.vip.gq1.yahoo.com."
indicating the rollingstone.com was being redirected to yahoo.com
- DNS runs on the Application Layer of the OSI Layer

Mitigation: 
- Default username and passwords should never be used and all of them should be changed and reset on all servers.
- Hosts file should only be monitored and given write access to limited staff.

Phase 4
- In the "/etc" directory, there was a file called "packetcaptureinfo.txt".
- In this file is a message that states:
  
My Captured Packets are here:
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ic-CFFGrbruloYrWaw3PvT71elTkh3eF/view?usp=sharing

- This link will take you to a download for the pcap packets. 
- The file is called `secretlogs.pcapng`  and was analyzed in Wireshark.

**HTTP finding**

- A filter was applied for HTTP
- Searched for the "POST" Request
- Expanded "HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
- There is a message that was sent from the hacker that states:
  
  ```
  "Hi Got The Blues Corp!  This is a hacker that works at Rock Star Corp.  Rock Star has left port 22, SSH open if you want to hack in.  For 1 Milliion Dollars I will provide you the user and password!"
  ```

- This indicated an insider that is trying to sell unauthorized access into RockStar Corp's system.
- The IP Address of the sender is: 10.0.2.15


- HTTP runs on is the Application Layer   
  
   
**ARP finding**

- A filter was applied for ARP.

- In packet 4, there is an ARP response indicating: 192.168.47.200 is at 00:0c:29:0f:71:a3.
- In packet 5, there is a spoof ARP response indicating the same IP of	192.168.47.200 is at a different MAC Address of 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1.
- Wireshark also indicates that this is a duplicate ARP response.
- This is indicating that the hacker's device likely has the MAC address of 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1 and they are creating a spoof record to direct the traffic intended for 92.168.47.200 over to his device.
- ARP runs on the Application Layer.

Mitigation: 
- To prevent ARP spoofing, RockStar Corp can start creating static ARP entries or purchase Networking technologies that can identify and stop Spoof ARP requests.
- RockStar Corp should consider launching an internal investigation and start with the owner of the device that has the MAC Address of:   00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1 (For the ARP Spoof) and also check the owner of the Device with the IP of 10.0.2.15.(For the HTTP Post request).
